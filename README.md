The purpose of this repo is the code that we utilized to deploy an api that gives you personalized recommendations. If recommendations are not returned we will turn to rss feed so you will not have the same recommendations and you will never be left without any.


### This Machine Learning Api is feed data from the Kaggle Job Dataset

### This was used for Computer Science 680 at California State University, Northridge.
